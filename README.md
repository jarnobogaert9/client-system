# Client System

This application is build to manage your clients. It is a place where you can store all the important details about a specific client.

## Structure

There are two main parts in the application. The front-end & the back-end. You can find the front-end in the 'client' folder and the back-end in the 'server' folder. This is done to seperate the front-end of the back-end and have a good structure and overview of the application.

## Purpose

Centralize all your clients in one place.
